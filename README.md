Zero-Day Synthetic Network Dataset  Records: 3,850 File type: CSV  This dataset simulates network traffic with a focus on zero-day attack detection and adversarial machine-learning scenarios (e.g., model poisoning). It contains a mix of normal and malicious events generated under non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions.
